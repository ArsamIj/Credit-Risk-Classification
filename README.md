# Credit-Risk-Classification

## Overview of Project
In this project I let supervised machine learning analyze 6 different models for sampling data for credit card applications, to determine whether or not the applicants qualify. I deploy supervised machine learning models to determine the eligibility of applicants for credit card loans. I analyze the confusion matrix to determine false negatives/positives and true negatives/positives to understand the precision and accuracy of each model
