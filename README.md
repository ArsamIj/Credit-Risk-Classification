# Credit-Risk-Classification

## Overview of Project
In this project I let supervised machine learning analyze 6 different models for sampling data for credit card applications, to determine whether or not the applicants qualify. I deploy supervised machine learning models to determine the eligibility of applicants for credit card loans. I analyze the confusion matrix to determine false negatives/positives and true negatives/positives to understand the precision and accuracy of each model

### Analysis
Accuracy score: 99.24%
With high precision on both targets, an accuracy score of 99.24% provide very high confidence in the logistic regression model's ability to provide accurate predictions.

## Logistics Regression Model With Resampled Data

### Analysis
Balanced accuracy score: 99.59%
Our resampled data was assessed to be even more precise with a balanced acccuracy score of 99.59%, which, although is only a little more than the already very precise original data based logistic regression model, can prove very efficient if the data sets were significantly larger.
